                    >Welcome to Collegehub Zimbabwe an online service for your daily convenience, from accommodation, taxi, restaurants and buying and selling we got you covered. In this blog I’m going to take you (Hubbers) through a history of how this company was started and also share with you our culture and goals. Before we dive deep into it, allow me to shift your attention to that opening quote by Robert L Peters. That statement fits well into our system at college hub. The website was designed in a unique way to offer the best user experience and to cater for the major concerns of our clients.</p>

                    >College hub was found in December 2018 and what drove our founders to creating this platform was the struggle, college students had to go through in order to secure external accommodation. We saw an very challenging situation for students and came up with a plan to tackle this problem for the student and that gave birth to collegehub.During the crafting of this intervention method we realized that students also struggled with other things, communication between different faculties, buying and selling wasn’t easy and efficient on campus, finding a taxi, among other things and we made it our goal to bring these services on one site.</p>

Welcome once again Hubbers, we promise you a smooth journey with us and we have your back all the way.</p>
